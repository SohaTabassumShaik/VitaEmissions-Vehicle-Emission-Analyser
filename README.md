**VitaEmissions: Vehicle Emission Analyzer**

**VitaEmissions** is a real-time vehicle emission analysis system designed to promote environmental compliance and reduce pollution. This smart dashboard classifies vehicle emissions, generates fine reports, issues voice alerts, and maps pollution hotspots ‚Äî all using Python.

**Overview**

Many vehicles contribute significantly to air pollution due to poor maintenance and lack of real-time emission tracking. VitaEmissions addresses this issue by:

- Analyzing CO, NOx, and PM2.5 levels
- Classifying vehicles based on their pollution status
- Generating PDF fine reports for high-emission vehicles
- Mapping emission hotspots with geospatial visualization
- Issuing real-time voice alerts

**Objectives**

- ‚úÖ Detect high-emission vehicles in real time
- ‚úÖ Provide digital emission classification
- ‚úÖ Support smart city and eco-policy enforcement
- ‚úÖ Encourage regular self-checks via digital tools

**Tech Stack & Tools**

1. Python ‚Äì Core logic and backend programming
2. Pandas ‚Äì Data manipulation and dataset creation
3. Streamlit ‚Äì Web-based dashboard and user interface
4. Plotly ‚Äì Interactive visualizations and charts
5. Seaborn ‚Äì Statistical data visualization
6. Folium ‚Äì Geo-mapping of emission hotspots
7. pyttsx3 ‚Äì Text-to-speech voice alerts
8. ReportLab ‚Äì PDF fine report generation

**Features**

‚úÖ Classify Emissions
- Accepts real-time values of **CO, NOx, PM2.5**
- Flags emissions as *Safe*, *Moderate*, or *Danger*
- Triggers voice alerts
- Logs data with timestamps and simulated locations

üìÑ Fine Report Generation
- Automatically generates a PDF report if pollution is in *Danger* range
- Includes pollutant levels, time, and simulated location

üìä Dataset Visualization
- Shows logged vehicle records
- Displays pollutant averages by vehicle type
- Shows emission status distribution via pie chart

üó∫Ô∏è Geo-Emission Map
- Plots vehicle emissions on an interactive map
- Color-coded markers based on emission status
- Popups display full emission details


**Results**

- Classified over 100 sample emission records across 4 vehicle types
- Generated real-time fine reports
- Visualized emission hotspots and patterns using charts and maps


**Sustainability & Impact**

- Enables real-time pollution monitoring for smart cities
- Helps authorities identify and penalize non-compliant vehicles
- Encourages citizens to stay environmentally responsible
- A step toward **green mobility** and **cleaner cities**

**Future Scope**

- Integrate **number plate detection** using OpenCV
- Connect with **real sensor APIs or IoT devices**
- Deploy for **traffic departments** and **eco-governance platforms**
